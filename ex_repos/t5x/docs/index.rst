******************************


T5X is a modular, composable, research-friendly framework for high-performance, 
configurable, self-service training, evaluation, and inference of sequence
models (starting with language) at many scales.

It is essentially a new and improved implementation of the
`T5 codebase <https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer/blob/main/README.md>`__
(based on Mesh TensorFlow) in JAX and Flax. To learn more, see the
`T5X Paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17189>`__.
