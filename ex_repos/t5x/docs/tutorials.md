# T5X Introductory Tutorial Series


## Overview

This series of guides is a self-contained introduction to T5X, a modular,
composable, research-friendly framework for high-performance, configurable,
self-service training, evaluation, and inference of sequence models (starting
with language) at many scales.


## How to Use These Guides

Most entries in this series are colab notebooks (click the blue banners to the
right of each heading below), allowing you to run our tutorial code
interactively. We encourage you to do that! Play around, change things, see what
happens!


## T5X Guides

### Codelab 1: An Introduction to T5X

<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-research/t5x/blob/main/t5x/notebooks/introduction.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open in colab" style="float:left"/></a><br>

In this colab, you will learn about some of the basic T5X components and put
them to use to run training, inference, and evaluation on natural text inputs.

### Codelab 2: Training Deep Dive

<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-research/t5x/blob/main/t5x/notebooks/training.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open in colab" style="float:left"/></a><br>

In this colab, you will dive into how to restore T5X models from checkpoints and
run training, while also getting an introduction to the T5X trainer.

### Codelab 3: Inference Deep Dive

<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-research/t5x/blob/main/t5x/notebooks/inference.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open in colab" style="float:left"/></a><br>

In this colab, you will dive into how the Interactive Model does decoding to
generate predictions and scores for a given input.

### Codelab 4: Evaluation Deep Dive

<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-research/t5x/blob/main/t5x/notebooks/evaluation.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open in colab" style="float:left"/></a><br>

In this colab, you will dive into how the InteractiveModel takes a batch of
inputs and targets and runs evaluation to produce various metrics.
